# ðŸ”¥ Roast Stack

A sassy Gen-Z AI that absolutely destroys your tech stack choices with surgical precision and zero chill.

## What is this?

## Features

- ðŸ”¥ **Multiple Roast Modes**: From mild seasoning to nuclear devastation
- âš¡ **Lightning Fast**: Because waiting for roasts is almost as painful as your tech choices
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design**: Looks good on all devices (unlike your code)

- ðŸ’¾ **Persistent Roasts**: Your shame is saved in localStorage

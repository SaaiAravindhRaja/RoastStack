# 🔥 Roast Stack

A no-holds-barred Gen-Z AI that absolutely obliterates your tech stack with surgical precision and zero chill.

## 🤔 What is this?

Ever lay awake at night wondering if your tech stack is a walking red flag? Wonder no more. **Roast Stack** is an AI-powered roast generator that serves up hilariously savage burns for your choice of frameworks, databases, and questionable architectural decisions.

From your 2008 LAMP stack to that 37-microservice monstrosity you call "scalable," Roast Stack sees all, judges all — and does *not* hold back.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔥 **Multiple Roast Modes**  
  Choose your spice level: *Mild Shade*, *Medium Petty*, or *Nuclear Devastation*

- ⚡ **Lightning Fast**  
  Delivers roasts faster than your CI/CD breaks in production

- 📱 **Fully Responsive**  
  Works on all screen sizes — unlike your 2000-line homepage CSS

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Sass**  
  Roasts generated using **Gemini API**, trained in the ancient art of tech sarcasm

- 💾 **Persistent Burn Storage**  
  Saves your roasts in `localStorage`, so you can reflect on your poor choices later
